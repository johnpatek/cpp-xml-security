This library was formerly part of the Apache Santuario project, where it was
retired due to lack of maintainers and interest, outside of the Shibboleth
Project, which agreed to fork the code for its own use to make it clear that
support for other third-party usage of the code should be stopped.

This code is solely intended for the use of the Shibboleth Project, and no
usage outside of that context is supported by us.

It will remain licensed under the Apache license as before, and we will
accept bug reports freely, but we make no guarantees as to whether any
issues that do not impact the Shibboleth Project will receive attention,
and all existing APIs and features not used by us are at risk or already
planned for removal.

If you use this code, you should stop doing so and find an alternative.
You have been warned.

Reporting Bugs:
---------------
A Jira instance is available.
https://issues.shibboleth.net/

Support:
--------
None, but in the context of Shibboleth itself, our
development list at dev@shibboleth.net may be used.
